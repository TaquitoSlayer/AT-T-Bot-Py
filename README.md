# AT&T-Bot-Py

A bot written in Python3 in hopes that you cop your Funko POP!
Making this public in hopes that everyone either gets one for personal, or a reseller gets one and ruins the market by selling for $1 profit fees ;)

## Installation
Make sure you have Python3.6 or above installed on your computer, followed by installing the requirements.txt

```bash
pip -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Very simple. Edit the config.json with your info, being anagolous to the examples already made.
If you want to run multiple "tasks", just add a comma, and copy and paste the next profile following proper json structure.

Worth noting, zip and zip_ship are zip code for billing and shipping respectively.

oh ya, run main.py when you're done editing config.json.
